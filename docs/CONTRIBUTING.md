# Quick guide for the process we use on GitHub

## Branches
### Main
`Main` is the latest code. Make sure to target all pull requests to the `Main` branch.

### Legacy
`Legacy` is the old code base of Quick Pad and is kept online for reference.

### Other branches
There are other branches as well on Quick Pad, these are usually for new features or changes that are still a work in progress and not yet ready to be merged into the `Main` branch. These branches are temporary and will be removed once the changes are merged into the `Main` branch.

## Contributing to Quick Pad

To get started, create a fork of the repository on GitHub. You will need to do that to make any changes. If you decide to make a change you should always base it off the `Main` branch. Once your change is completed, you can open a pull request in which we will review and merge if approved.
